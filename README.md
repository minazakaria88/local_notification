### Explanation:

1. **Android Permissions**:
   - Permissions like `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, and `USE_EXACT_ALARM` are necessary for scheduling and receiving notifications, especially after a device reboot or during exact alarm triggers.

2. **Receivers**:
   - The `ScheduledNotificationReceiver` and `ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver` help handle notifications on specific events like app updates and system reboots.
   
3. **Debug and Release Modes**:
   - The instructions are clearly split into **debug** and **release** setups.
   - For **debug mode**, the setup is typically ready once the permissions and receivers are added to the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
   - For **release mode**, you'll need to include the Proguard configuration and Keep XML to ensure that the required classes aren't stripped during minification or obfuscation.

4. **External Links**:
   - The Proguard configuration file and Keep XML file are linked, and you need to download and add them to the appropriate directories in your project.

5. **Final Steps**:
   - After following all the steps, you should be able to build and test the app in both debug and release modes with working scheduled notifications.
